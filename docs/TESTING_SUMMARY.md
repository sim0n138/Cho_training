## 📋 Test Coverage Details

### recommendationService Tests

**Scenario Coverage:**
- ✅ All recommendation types (rest, recovery, moderate, intensive)
- ✅ Energy level thresholds (≤2, =3, ≥4)
- ✅ Sleep quality thresholds (≤2, =3, ≥4)
- ✅ Muscle pain handling (0, 1-2, ≥3 areas)
- ✅ Motivation messages (0, 1-2, 3-4, 5+ logs per week)
- ✅ Edge cases (boundary values, combinations)

**Sample Tests:**
```javascript
✓ should return rest recommendation when no log provided
✓ should return rest recommendation for low energy (energyLevel <= 2)
✓ should return recovery recommendation for significant muscle pain (>= 3 areas)
✓ should return intensive recommendation for high energy and good sleep
✓ should return excellent message for 5+ logs this week
```

### storageService Tests

**Functionality Coverage:**
- ✅ Get logs (empty, populated, error cases)
- ✅ Get latest log (empty, populated)
- ✅ Add log (to empty storage, append to existing)
- ✅ Get logs from last N days (recent, old, exact cutoff)
- ✅ Calculate statistics (empty, averages, weekly count)
- ✅ Clear logs (populated, empty)

**Sample Tests:**
```javascript
✓ should return empty array when no logs exist
✓ should return empty array on parse error
✓ should append log to existing logs
✓ should return logs from the last N days
✓ should calculate correct averages
✓ should clear all logs from storage
```

### Program Generator Tests

**Algorithm Coverage:**
- ✅ Pack by minutes (tolerance, empty list, edge cases)
- ✅ Get most frequent area (empty, single, multiple, ties)
- ✅ Filter by pain (no pain, single, multiple, unknown)
- ✅ RPE-based adjustments (high, low, medium)
- ✅ Level filtering (high RPE = level 1 only, normal = levels 1-2)
- ✅ History management (save, limit to 10, non-repetition)
- ✅ Constants validation (10% tolerance)

**Sample Tests:**
```javascript
✓ should pack exercises within tolerance range
✓ should return "general" for empty array
✓ should filter out exercises with painful areas
✓ should reduce volume for high RPE (>= 7)
✓ should only allow level 1 for high RPE (>= 7)
✓ should limit history to 10 programs
```
