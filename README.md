## Data Storage

The application uses browser's localStorage to persist wellbeing logs. Data is stored under the key `training_logs` as a JSON array.

## Exercise Database

The application includes a comprehensive database of **340+ scientifically-based exercises**, all in Russian:
- **120 stretching exercises** (Растяжка) - improving flexibility and mobility
- **120 therapeutic/LFC exercises** (ЛФК) - rehabilitation and strengthening  
- **100 meditation exercises** (Медитация) - mental wellness and stress reduction

All exercises are:
- ✅ In Russian language (весь текст на русском)
- ✅ Scientifically-based (научно обоснованно)
- ✅ Categorized by difficulty level (1-3)
- ✅ Tagged by body areas for smart filtering
- ✅ Integrated with RPE and pain area filtering

See [Exercise Database Documentation](docs/EXERCISE_DATABASE.md) for details.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with **57 tests** covering:

- **recommendationService**: 19 tests
  - All recommendation scenarios (rest, recovery, moderate, intensive)
  - Motivation message generation
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions

- **storageService**: 16 tests
  - CRUD operations on localStorage
  - Date-based filtering
